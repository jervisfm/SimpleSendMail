Introduction
============
This is a simple python program that aims to provide a simpler interface to sendmail
for sending textual emails. 

It is primarily designed to run on UNIX system that have the sendmail utility installed. 

The primary motivation came from find the sendmail interface too arcane to send a simple email. 
I felt overwhelemd by the sheer number of options which are exposed to the user. This script hides
all that complexity and presents a simple interface. 


Dependency
==========
###Argparse:
This is used to do argument processing so the argparse module should be install. This
module should be standard on Python 2.7 and later.

If you are on an older version of python, you can still install argparse through the PIP Python
Package manager. From your terminal execute:

$ pip install argparse
